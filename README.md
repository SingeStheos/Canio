# Canio
A Unity port of Balatro

Canio intends to be a more robust and crash-free version of Balatro with additional features, faster gameplay, and higher frames. Once Canio is very similar to Balatro, nearing perfection, it will be unavailable to download publically to avoid copyright infringement, until LocalThunk approves our port.
